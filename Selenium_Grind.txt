Selenium Grid: in two different machine

Keep selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar file in both machine in some location.
Open command prompt in both machine and navigate to the location where we kept the jar file.
	Tips: go to the folder and Shift+Right Mouse click
	This will open command prompt in particular location.
	Example: I kept my jar file in Desktop/Selenium folder. So i went to Selenium folder and Shift+Right Click and i got my command prompt.
